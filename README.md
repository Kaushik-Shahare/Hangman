# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This classic word-guessing game challenges you to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. Be careful, though â€“ you only have a limited number of attempts before the game ends!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Kaushik-Shahare/Hangman.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Game Directory:**
   - Move to the Hangman game directory:
     ```bash
     cd Hangman
     ```

3. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute the game script to start playing:
     ```bash
     python3 hangman.py
     ```

4. **Guess the Word:**
   - The game will randomly select a word, hiding it with underscores.
   - Guess letters one at a time by entering them and pressing `Enter`.
   - You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word.

5. **Win or Lose:**
   - If you guess the word before running out of attempts, you win!
   - If you use up all your attempts without guessing the word, the game ends, and you lose.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game by modifying the word list, adjusting the number of attempts, or adding new features to the code.

Have fun playing Hangman!
